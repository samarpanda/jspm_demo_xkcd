# JSPM Demo
Demo of [JSPM.IO](http://jspm.io/) a frictionless browser package management.

This repo uses ES6 syntax and [jspm](http://jspm.io/) to fetch random comics from [XKCD](http://c.xkcd.com/random/comic/)

P.S: This piece of work was influenced by Glen Maddern's [loopgifs](https://github.com/geelen/loopgifs) and Hemanth.HM [xkcd](https://github.com/hemanth/hello-jspm)
